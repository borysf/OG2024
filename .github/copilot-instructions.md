# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions 🔧

Purpose
- Quick, actionable onboarding for AI agents working on this repository.
- This repo is a dataset of API JSON responses (Olympics 2024, football/FBL). There is no application code or CI yet; agents should treat this as a canonical data archive and make conservative edits.

Quick facts ✅
- Top-level directory: `example/` contains all data files (JSON). Example: `GLO_EventGames~comp=OG2024~event=FBLMTEAM11------------~lang=ENG.json`.
- Filenames encode resource + query params separated by `~` (e.g., `SCH_ByDisciplineH2H~comp=OG2024~disc=FBL~lang=ENG~date=2024-08-05.json`).
- Many files are duplicated with suffixes like ` (1)`, ` (2)` — treat these as copies to be deduped/normalized when introducing tooling.

Data shape highlights (use these keys to find data quickly) 🔎
- Top-level objects often include `event`, `competitions`, or resource-specific root keys.
- Typical nesting for game data (see `GLO_EventGames…` files):
  - `event` → `phases[]` → `units[]` → `schedule` → `start[]` (participants) and `result` → `items[]` (team results)
  - Useful fields: `event.code`, `units[].code`, `schedule.startDate`, `schedule.endDate`, `result.status.code`, `result.items[].resultDataText` and `participant.code`.

Search & sample commands you can run locally (macOS) 💻
- List files matching a resource: rg "^GLO_" -g example/**
- Find all occurrences of an event id: rg "FBLMTEAM11" example/**
- Inspect a JSON path with `jq`: jq '.event.phases[0].units[0].schedule | {startDate, status, result}' example/GLO_EventGames~*.json
- Deduplicate/normalize filenames: use a script to strip trailing ` (n)` and ensure deterministic naming.

Agent behaviour rules (project-specific) ⚠️
- Do not introduce runtime code without a short README and tests. This repo is currently a data snapshot — changes should be documented.
- Prefer non-destructive edits: add scripts under `tools/` or `scripts/` (create these dirs if needed) and include examples of usage.
- When adding derived artifacts (CSV, normalized JSON), put them in `out/` or `derived/` and add a short `README.md` describing generation steps.

Conventions and gotchas 📌
- Filename params map to query params in the source API. Preserve them in any canonicalized filename you create (e.g., `SCH_ByDisciplineH2H~comp=OG2024~disc=FBL~date=2024-07-24.json`).
- Multiple copies with ` (1)`, ` (2)` likely indicate repeated downloads; handle by checksum/dedup and keep the most complete/most recent one.
- Schema is fairly stable across files — use example file `example/GLO_EventGames~comp=OG2024~event=FBLMTEAM11------------~lang=ENG.json` as canonical example for extracting teams/results.

Suggested first tasks for agents (concrete) 🛠️
1. Add `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (this file) and a repo `README.md` describing "this is a dataset" and how to query it.
2. Add a `scripts/validate_jsons.py` or `scripts/validate.sh` that runs a set of `jq`-based assertions (presence of `event.code`, `units[].schedule.startDate`, etc.).
3. Add a `scripts/dedupe_filenames.py` script that normalizes file names and logs any collisions.
4. Add `derived/README.md` if you add derived files describing provenance and generation command.

If you need to modify data:
- Always add a short `*.md` describing why and how you changed files (provenance). Prefer adding normalized outputs under `derived/` and keep raw files untouched.

Where to look (examples) 📁
- Canonical sample: `example/GLO_EventGames~comp=OG2024~event=FBLMTEAM11------------~lang=ENG.json`
- Resources: any files starting with `GLO_`, `SCH_`, `RES_`, `CIS_`, `MIS_`, `SEL_`, `SRM_`.
